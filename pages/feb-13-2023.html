    <h2>On Sleep</h2>
    <p>Today's topic of discussion will be sleep. Why sleep? You may ask. Because sleep is one of the biggest challenges I will need to overcome to become a better man, according to Aristotle at least, a man more alive and a man more able to experience. Speaking in more conventional terms, the less I sleep, the more time I have for other things, for example: PHILOSOPHY. On the other hand, of course, we have the <q>problem</q> that sleep is necessary, and an absence of it will kill you. Dismissing Aristotle's advantage completely. I am fortunate in that I can get my <q>good</q> eight hours of sleep, although they never feel like enough. The questions to answer are: Are they enough? If they aren't how many do I need? If they are, what is keeping me from waking up quickly and effortlessly? I hope that by addressing this question I will be able to live more and thus become a better person (in the sense of a good person, who is able to commit more good than he used to).</p>
    <p>The fist step in solving these questions is understanding the importance of sleep. According to Mathew Walker's <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com.mx/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144324/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=7IRAUURMCQ22&keywords=why+we+sleep&qid=1676293023&sprefix=why+we+sleep%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-1">Why we sleep</a></em>, sleep is important fo health, memory, creativity, performance, and more. Insufficient sleep will cause fatigue which will hinder one's ability to concentrate, which will hinder one's ability to be creative, productive, and to pay attention to things. Decreased sleep will also make you more likely to have Alzheimer's, cancer, heart attacks and other diseases. Sleep also enhances one's overall understanding of the world as well as ones ability to learn new things by creating cycles of assimilation (dreams) and accommodation (deep sleep) throughout the night. 7 to 9 hours of sleep are recommended for most people.</p>
    <p>Now that I understand the importance of sleep I can also be able to determine wether I'm getting enough sleep or not by paying attention to the effects the book warns about. While some, like UCI health say that a sign that you are not getting enough sleep is if <q>need an alarm clock to wake up</q> I don't necessarily think this is the case. I say this due to personal experience, and to the body's adaptability. I remember when I was younger (and supposed to sleep more) that I would wake up at seven a.m. in weekends because it was what I was used to and because of how excited I was to start the day and play some videogames. Nowadays, I don't have a regular wake up time, and it is always difficult to wake up even when sleeping way over 8 hours. My suspicion? These difficulties stem from a lack of motivation, if this is the case, understanding the lack of motivation by, lets say, writing a philosophical essay can help me with this. If a lack of motivation is not the cause, I will be able to notice this by paying attention to any of the following problems in the next couple of weeks (assuming I'm able to maintain the sleep patter of going to bed at 10p.m. and waking up at 6a.m.):</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Unable to concentrate</li>
            <li>Increased appetite</li>
            <li>Decreased performance in tennis</li>
            <li>Difficulty memorizing and understanding the concepts seen in class and in coding</li>
        </ul>
    <p>if any of this begin to happen, I will aim for an extra half hour of sleep, I think the most obvious to me will be the inability to concentrate. Since writing and reading will be the first thing I do in the morning, if I become unable to do it then it must meant I am not getting enough sleep.</p>

    <h3>Feb-16-2023</h3>
    <p>After a couple of days of trying this experiment this is what I have found, it seems like waking up at 6a.m. is enough sleep for me, I didn't see any increased levels of fatigue, I was able to concentrate and learn new things, and it made me happy to have an extra time to write. However even though it is enough sleep waking up at 6a.m. was still very difficult some days. For example today, I was unable to wake up at 6a.m. and I am now writing from school. Therefore, (assuming longer periods of waking up at 6a.m. won't be detrimental) the questions to answer are, why is waking up at 6a.m. so difficult? What could I do to make waking up at 6a.m. easier?</p>
