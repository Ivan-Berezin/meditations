    <h2>On Sleep</h2>
    <p>Today's topic of discussion will be sleep. Why sleep? You may ask. Because sleep is one of the biggest challenges I will need to overcome to become a better man, according to Aristotle at least, a man more alive and a man more able to experience. Speaking in more conventional terms, the less I sleep, the more time I have for other things, for example: PHILOSOPHY. On the other hand, of course, we have the <q>problem</q> that sleep is necessary, and an absence of it will kill you. Dismissing Aristotle's advantage completely. I am fortunate in that I can get my <q>good</q> eight hours of sleep, although they never feel like enough. The question to answer is: Are they enough? If they aren't how many do I need? If they are, what is keeping me from waking up quickly and effortlessly? I hope that by adressing this question I will be able to live more and thus become a better person (in the sense of a good person, who is able to commit more good than he used to).</p>
